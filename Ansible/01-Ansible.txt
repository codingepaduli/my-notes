Ansible is simple open source IT engine which automates operations.

Ansible works by connecting your nodes (your machines in LAN or internet) through ssh (by default).
After connecting to your nodes, Ansible pushes small programs called as “Ansible Modules”, runs that modules and removes them when finished.

A file /etc/ansible/hosts is used to list all the nodes Ansible needs to connect. You can group nodes. 

Esample of /etc/ansible/hosts file:
# File name: /etc/ansible/hosts
[group1]
localhost ansible_user=Me ansible_connection=local
[group2]
1.2.3.4 ansible_user=Me ansible_connection=ssh

A playbook is written in YAML (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).
The first line is "---"

The painful errors about YAML are:
* Strings have to be sorrounded by double quotes, for example "this is a string".
* List elements starts with "-".
* Each item property must be placed exactly below the item (with the same spaces number).

Example:
---
- name: "playbook01"
  hosts: 
    - "localhost"

If you write "hosts" with more or less spaces (" "), the syntax is wrong, for example:
- name: "playbook01"
    hosts:
    ^ The offending line appears here, wrong syntax 

To run a playbook, use the command:
ansible-playbook playbook.yml

To check the playbook syntax, use the command
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --syntax-check

To specify the file containing all the hosts, use:
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i ansibleHosts.ini

When you run a playbook, Ansible notify you that something has changed with the 
property changed: true and the yellow output, and notify you nothing has changed
with the property changed: false and the green output.


You can add variables in the top of a playbook, for example:
---
http_port: 80

You can add variables for each host, for example:
---
- hosts: "localhost"
  vars: 
      backup_folder: "~/backup/"


When connected to a host, you can 'become' a privileged user (like root) setting:
become: "true"
become_user: "apache"
become_method: "su"

but the user "apache" needs rights to start a shell as root, so test it as ssh apache@host and, after, try apt-get update. If you have the error:
    Can't open the file /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (13: Access denied)
you don't have the rights. 

Retry ssh apache@host and try "su" and apt-get update. If you become root, you can 'become' the user apache.

In order to start the playbook and ask for a password:
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-become-pass
